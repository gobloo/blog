# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Security Footage CTF Forensics Tryhackme

Ever unraveled a seemingly ordinary PCAP file only to discover a hidden trove of digital clues? This challenge was exactly that kind of forensic puzzle ‚Äî diving deep into network traffic to recover destroyed security footage. From dissecting TCP streams and decoding hex dumps to carving out fragmented images and reconstructing video footage, this investigation tested every step of the forensic toolkit. Join me as I break down the process, relying solely on command-line tools and scripting to piece together the story hidden in the chaos of captured packets.

## üìò Challenge Overview

**Room Link:** [Security Footage](https://tryhackme.com/room/securityfootage)

> Perform digital forensics on a network capture to recover footage from a camera.

> Someone broke into our office last night, but they destroyed the hard drives with the security footage. Can you recover the footage?

> Today chall will be based on CLI only, bit challenging since I was using WSL not my kali machine. lets see how do i solve it.

## üîç Initial Network Analysis

1. Opened the provided PCAP file using **tshark** in `wsl`.
2. Checked the **Protocol Hierarchy** to get an overview of protocols present I used **`my own script`** to do this.
3. Found **HTTP traffic** under TCP streams, indicating possible **file transfers** or **data exfiltration**.

## üì¶ Data Extraction and Analysis

1. Followed the HTTP streams.
![HTTP follow stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/02_follow_stream_http.png)

2. Initial HTTP payload **decoding** revealed nothing significant.
![HTTP follow stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/02_follow_stream_http_decoded.png)

3. Shifted focus to **TCP streams**

4. Decode the tcp paylaod, It appeared more promising.

![TCP Decoded file save](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/04_tcp_stream_save.png)

5. Cleaned the output by deleting **irrelevant first lines** from script output.
![clean the file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/05_tcp_stream_without_firstlines_outputs.png)

6. Converted the **cleaned hex data** to raw bytes for further inspection.

7. Identified the data as a raw file and checked its **file type**.

![clean raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/08_delete_first_lines.png)

File type recognized as a **JPEG JFIF image**.

## üî• Image Analysis and Data Recovery

1. Opened the extracted JPEG image; it contained the flag **first 4 caracters**.
![file open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/10_fileOpened.png)

2. Noticed the image size was unusually large **(5.7 MB)**, `suspicious` for a simple flag image.
![file type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/11_file_size.png)

3. Hypothesized that the image contained **hidden or fragmented data**, possibly remnants of destroyed footage, let's try to carve data from the raw image file.
![file type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/12_extraction.png)

4. Extracted **541 images** from the data, confirming extensive hidden content.
![file type](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/13_extraction_images_1.png)

5. Verified the **first** extracted image matched the original suspicious image.
![first image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/14_first_image.png)

6. Checked the **last** extracted image
![last image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/15_last_image.png)
![random image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/15_random_image.png)

- all images contained parts of the flag or relevant data.

## üß† Reconstruction and Final Recovery

1. Decided to **reconstruct the extracted images** into a **video** file to recover the original footage.
    - First, lets order the images by name
    ```bash
    ls *.jpg | sort | sed "s/^/file '/; s/$/'/" > images.txt
    ```


2. Used video creation tool **`ffmpeg`** to assemble images into an MP4 video.

```bash
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i images.txt -vsync vfr -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 flag.mp4
```
![video recration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gobloo/blog/refs/heads/main/_posts/Footage/images/18_flag_video_creation.png)

3. The reconstructed video revealed the **final flag**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bonus: Extraction Automation via python Script

```py
def split_chunks(data, delimiter="ffd8ff"):
    chunks = []
    start = 0 # Start the split at the beginning of the data
    while True:
        index = data.find(delimiter, start) # Find the next occurrence of the delimiter
        if index == -1:
            break
        
        chunk = data[index:index + len(delimiter)] # Add the chunk starting from the delimiter
        next_index = data.find(delimiter, index + len(delimiter)) # Keep adding until the next delimiter
        if next_index == -1:
            chunks.append(data[index:])
            break
        else:
            chunks.append(data[index:next_index])

        start = next_index + len(delimiter) # the next delimiter
    
    return chunks

def hex_to_bytes(hex_string):
    return bytes.fromhex(hex_string) # Convert hex to bytes

def save_chunk_as_file(chunk, chunk_number):
    byte_data = hex_to_bytes(chunk)  # Convert the hex chunk to bytes
    
    with open(f"chunk_{chunk_number}.jpg", "wb") as f:
        f.write(byte_data)
    print(f"Saved chunk_{chunk_number}.jpg")

# usage
data = open("footage.txt").read()
chunks = split_chunks(data)

# save each chunk in a file
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    save_chunk_as_file(chunk, i + 1)

```

## ‚úÖ Outcome

Successfully:

    - extracted and identified a hidden JPEG image containing the flag.
    - Recovered fragmented images embedded in the data stream.
    - Reconstructed the images into a video file.
    - Retrieved the final flag from the recovered footage.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- `tshark` (CLI packet analysis)
- Custom hex decoding scripts
- `foremost` (data carving)
- `file` (file type identification)
- `ffmpeg` (video creation from images)

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

- This challenge was tackled entirely on the command line using tools like tshark and custom scripts, which made the analysis more challenging but showcased how powerful CLI-based PCAP analysis can be.

- Working without GUI tools required careful stream decoding, hex conversions, and data carving purely via CLI utilities.

- Reassembling extracted images into a video is a creative approach to reconstruct destroyed footage.
